Her grandchildren loved visiting her, especially on cookie day. They would help her mix the dough, and grandma would tell them stories about her childhood. She would say, “When I was your age, we didn’t have computers. We played outside all day!”

After the cookies were baked, they would all sit together, sharing laughs and enjoying the delicious treats. Grandma Mary always reminded them that family time is the sweetest time of all.
